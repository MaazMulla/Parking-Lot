# Parking-Lot
A project for my datastructures class. We have two stacks (two lanes) in which we can park cars. If the lanes are full we put 10 cars on the street.
After each time we remove a car from the lot we take a car from the street and aadd itinto the lot with the open spot. Used Push and Pop to add and remove
cars from the lanes.
